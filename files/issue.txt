## Whitelisting Issue

# Delay between the curl request to MongoDB Atlas API to whitelist the ec2 instance IP, 
and actually whitelisting the instance

When the service is run on the instance to start the container running the application,
the ip is still not yet whitelisted, so the server cannot connect to the database, and errors

# Options

1. Sleep
    Pros: Easy
    Cons: Inefficient use of time, No error handling if request fails or if takes longer than usual to whitelist

2. Request to check the status of the whitelisting every few seconds, when available, resume script
    Pros: More efficient use of time, cool/relatively easy to implement
    Cons: Can be a lot of requests - may use up quota for free usage

3. Error handling on the application side, if server doesn't connect, can it retry after X amount of time
    Pros: More resilient solution, not dependent on infrastructure, more efficient use of time
    Cons: more difficult at present to implement
